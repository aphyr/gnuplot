# Gnuplot

A really simple Clojure interface to Gnuplot. Useful when you just wanna plot
some points. A lot of points. More points than Incanter or Analemma can
reasonably handle.

## Usage

I dunno bout the API here, so I'm calling it `raw-plot!` Maybe I'll wrap it in
a nicer `plot` api later. Just need something simple n flexible for now.

```clj
(require '[gnuplot.core :as g])
(g/raw-plot! ; Commands
             [[:set :title "simple-test"]
              [:plot (g/range 0 5)
               (g/list ["-" :title "rising" :with :lines]
                       ["-" :title "falling" :with :impulse])]]
             ; Datasets
             [[[0 0]
               [1 1]
               [2 2]
               [3 1]
               [4 3]
               [5 4]]
              [[0 5]
               [1 4]
               [2 3]
               [3 2]
               [4 1]
               [5 0]]]))
```
